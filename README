v1.0.1
-- Updated some test cases that relied too heavily on classes other than the one they were testing. 
-- Created a NULL objects for the SQLStatement and Clause interfaces.
-- Changed the StandardConnection.execute() to always return a Result object instead of ever returning null.
-- Updated various SQLStatement.getStatement() algorithms so null values are not used. 
-- Made the exception message for TypeNotRegisteredException more descriptive.
-- Created a new exception to throw when attempting illegal operations on an explicitly constructed null object.

v1.0.2
-- Created a TypeLoader class that handles loading all the different Clause, Statement, and Connection types in order to register them with factories. This TypeLoader is used in a static code block in the factory classes to elliminate the need for the programmer to worry about explicitly loading a class.
-- Fixed minor bug in DBProperties involving improper handling of newline and tab characters during XML parsing.

v1.1.0
-- Fixed a bug that prevented SELECT statements from being created with more than one JOIN clause. 
-- Statements can now be constructed by passing a JSON formatted String as an argument to the Factory method.
-- Results can now return the data in in JSON format by calling Result.JSONString().

v1.2.0
-- Fixed a but that prevented creating a VALUES clause with multiple tuples.
-- Multiple rows can now be added via INSERT statements by successive calls to insertStmt.addClause("values", <comma separated values string>)
-- Multiple rows insertion was added to the JSON functionality. 
-- SELECT statements now support GROUP BY clauses.
