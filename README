v1.0.1
-- Updated some test cases that relied too heavily on classes other than the one they were testing. 
-- Created a NULL objects for the SQLStatement and Clause interfaces.
-- Changed the StandardConnection.execute() to always return a Result object instead of ever returning null.
-- Updated various SQLStatement.getStatement() algorithms so null values are not used. 
-- Made the exception message for TypeNotRegisteredException more descriptive.
-- Created a new exception to throw when attempting illegal operations on an explicitly constructed null object.

v1.0.2
-- Created a TypeLoader class that handles loading all the different Clause, Statement, and Connection types in order to register them with factories. This TypeLoader is used in a static code block in the factory classes to elliminate the need for the programmer to worry about explicitly loading a class.
-- Fixed minor bug in DBProperties involving improper handling of newline and tab characters during XML parsing.

v1.1.0
-- Fixed a bug that prevented SELECT statements from being created with more than one JOIN clause. 
-- Statements can now be constructed by passing a JSON formatted String as an argument to the Factory method.
-- Results can now return the data in in JSON format by calling Result.JSONString().

v1.2.0
-- Fixed a but that prevented creating a VALUES clause with multiple tuples.
-- Multiple rows can now be added via INSERT statements by successive calls to insertStmt.addClause("values", <comma separated values string>)
-- Multiple rows insertion was added to the JSON functionality. 
-- SELECT statements now support GROUP BY clauses.

v1.3.0
-- Added very basic logging using java.util.logging. Logs are output to zoedb.log
-- Logging consists of information regarding acquisition and release of connections from the connection pool, output of SQL statement to be executed, output of JSON strings to be converted, and exception messages that are thrown.
-- SELECT statements now support LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN clauses.

v1.3.1
-- Removed logging features as they were far too verbose. May reconsider at a later time.
-- Fixed bug where DELETE clauses were not pulling the default schema from ZoeDB.properties
-- Updated unit tests and the included sample ZoeDB.properties file so that executed statements will look for data in the "sakila" database that MySQL provides as a test DB.
-- Refactored unit tests to rely less heavily on classes outside those that they are testing. 
-- Fixed a bug where DB connections were being made and never closed causing timeout errors. 
-- Fixed a bug where DELETE statements were not outputting correct DB when explicitly declared in the constructor.
-- Fixed a bug where statements and clauses were not properly setting the DB to use.
